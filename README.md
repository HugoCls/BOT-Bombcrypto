## Project Introduction

**Bombcrypto** is a game following the **"Play-to-Earn"** model, featuring a group of bomb heroes in search of the BCOIN. The game operates on the **Binance blockchain**, with the **BCOIN token** serving as the primary in-game currency on the **BNB Chain**. The project aimed to **maximize BCOIN generation** by **automating all game tasks**, implementing optimized rules, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> On November 29, 2021, BCOIN reached its peak value of $8.2 before plummeting significantly.

## Technical Overview

### Maximizing Gameplay

#### The optimized loop

aaa

#### Browser Management

Efficient management of multiple browser instances was essential for maximizing gameplay. Each browser was controlled independently to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.

--> Metamask Integration


### Automating Gameplay

#### Computer Vision & Automated Input Generation

The project utilized computer vision for automatic generation of keyboard and mouse inputs, browser management, Metamask connections, server crash handling, and most importantly, the creation and management of optimal game loops for each browser.

Automated input generation played a crucial role in executing game actions efficiently. This included simulating keyboard and mouse inputs to interact with the game interface seamlessly.



Integration with Metamask facilitated seamless transactions within the game environment, allowing for the smooth transfer of BCOIN tokens and other in-game assets.

#### Captchas & Server Crash Handling

Robust mechanisms were implemented to handle server crashes gracefully, ensuring minimal disruption to gameplay and maximizing uptime of the automation system.

#### Supervision and Monitoring

Supervision and monitoring mechanisms were developed to maintain oversight of the automation system. This included sending periodic screenshots, logging detailed action records locally, and providing important information logs on Discord for real-time monitoring.
